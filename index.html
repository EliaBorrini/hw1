  <p>
    Mark is a <span class="important">specialist for NASA</span> and currently assigned to the Ares 3 mission to Mars.
    He has a track record of radical ingenuity and a never-say-die attitude.
    He is a <span>good team player</span> (though he tends to insult them sometimes).
    Mark can improvise creative solutions with nothing more than duct tape and water.
    However, he tends to get left behind by his colleagues.
